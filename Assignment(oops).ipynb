        "# THEORY QUESTIONS\n",
        "\n",
        "1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        " - Object oriented programming is a style of programming that is based on objects. this is a powerful programming style to handel large projects.\n",
        "  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        " - class is a blueprint or we can say template for creating objects/instances.\n",
        " - ex - class car: #body\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- object is an instance of class which mean objects are associated with class they follow the blueprint of the class and used to call methods,variables of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- abstraction is a process of hiding the complex computation part of and only showing the essential features.\n",
        " - focuses on what an object does not how it does it.\n",
        "- encapsulation is a process of binding data and methods together in a class and not allowing direct access to data.\n",
        "- focus on protecting the data\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- dunder methods are also know as magic or special method that are defined by start and end using double undescore.\n",
        "- ex - _init_\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPs?\n",
        "- interitance is a concept used in between classes to access the property and methods of one class(child) to other class (parent).\n",
        "- It helps in code reusability, reducing redundancy, and maintaining cleaner code.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is a concept that allows the same function or method to behave differently depending on the object that calls it.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- encapsusaltion is achived by making by using access modifiers- public,private,protected. they control the access of class attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- constructor are the method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.\n",
        "-  it is mainly use to initialize object attributes.\n",
        "- ex - class car: def __init_ :\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- A class method is used when you want a method that works with the class itself, not instances.It takes cls (class) as its first parameter instead of self.\n",
        "- A static method is like a normal function inside a class — it doesn’t depend on the class or instance.It takes no self or cls parameters.\n",
        "-  define it using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Method Overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters so that the correct version of the method runs based on the arguments passed.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOPs?\n",
        "- Method overriding happens when a child (subclass) defines a method with the same name, same parameters, and same return type as a method in its parent (superclass).\n",
        "- purpose of using it to make the changes in the method without changing the parentclass itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- The @property decorator in Python is used to define getters, setters, and deleters in an elegant way allowing methods to be accessed like attributes.\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism allows the same code to work for different types of objects — making OOP flexible, reusable, and elegant.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class is like a template it tells what methods a subclass should have,but leaves how they work up to the subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.  What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming helps in building software that is modular, reusable, secure, easy to maintain, and scalable making it ideal for large and complex projects. where handling functions can be typical.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- Class Variable is\ta variable that is shared by all objects of a class. It belongs to the class itself.\n",
        "- Instance variable that is unique to each object (instance). It belongs to the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- Multiple Inheritance means a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class.\n",
        "- A child class (subclass) can have multiple base classes (parents).\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in PythonH\n",
        "- _str_ - Defines the user-friendly string representation of an object (used for printing).\n",
        "- __repr__ - Defines the developer-friendly or unambiguous string representation (used for debugging).\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "- The super() function is used to call a method from the parent (superclass) inside the child (subclass).\n",
        "- It gives you access to the parent class’s methods, constructors, or properties, without directly naming the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- __del__() is used to define cleanup actions — for example, closing files, releasing memory, or disconnecting from a network.\n",
        "- ex - class ClassName:\n",
        "    def __del__(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Destructor called\")\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- @staticmethod → A method that doesn’t access class or instance data; used for independent utility functions.\n",
        "- @classmethod → A method that takes cls as the first argument and can access or modify class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "- When a child class overrides a method from its parent class,\n",
        "and both have a method with the same name and parameters,\n",
        "Python decides at runtime which version to call based on the object type.\n",
        "- also known as method overriding\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Method chaining in Python means calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line, one after another.\n",
        "- ex - obj.method1().method2().method3()\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __call__() method in Python allows an instance (object) of a class to be called like a function.\n",
        "- ex - obj = MyClass()\n",
        "obj()   \n"
