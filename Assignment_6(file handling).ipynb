        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "- interpreted languages read the code line by line and compiled languages use compiler which complie all the lines of code at the run time.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "- exception handling is the method to detect and manage errors that occur while the programm is running so that programm will not crash unexpectedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling ?\n",
        "-  finally block is used as a closing block of code it runs regardless of the error occurence or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "- Logging in Python is a way to record important information about events that occur while a program is running. It helps developers track the flow of the program, debug issues, and understand problems without stopping the program or using print statements everywhere.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, the __del__ method is a destructor method that is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., when the object’s reference count reaches zero, or when the program ends). It is used to perform cleanup operations such as closing files, releasing memory, or disconnecting from a database.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "- Both are used to call a module but works diffrently as import is used to call a complete module and must be called use as prefix and from is used to call the specific object like func,method from a module.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "- there are multiple ways to handel errors.\n",
        " - using multiple except blocks\n",
        " - using single except block.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "- The with statement in Python is used to manage resources like files, ensuring that they are properly opened and automatically closed after their usage—even if an error occurs. It is most commonly used when working with files.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "- Multithreading involves running multiple threads within the same process, where all threads share the same memory space. It is most effective for I/O-bound tasks such as handling user requests, reading and writing files, or performing network operations, because the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python allows only one thread to execute Python code at a time, limiting true parallel execution\n",
        "- multiprocessing uses multiple independent processes, each with its own separate memory space, enabling true parallelism without being restricted by the GIL. This makes multiprocessing ideal for CPU-bound tasks like heavy computations, data processing, image rendering, or machine learning operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program ?\n",
        "- Logging provides a systematic way to record events and errors during program execution.\n",
        "It helps in debugging and identifying issues without stopping the program.\n",
        "Logs can be saved to files for later analysis and monitoring.\n",
        "It offers different log levels and makes applications easier to maintain and track.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "- Memory management in Python refers to how Python handles the allocation and deallocation of memory automatically during program execution.\n",
        "It uses a private heap to store objects and the Python memory manager allocates space as needed.\n",
        "Python also includes garbage collection to free up memory by removing unused objects.\n",
        "This automatic process makes memory usage efficient and reduces the chance of memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The basic steps in exception handling begin with placing risky code inside a try block.If an error occurs, it is caught by an except block where the exception is handled.Optionally, an else block runs if no exception occurs.\n",
        "Finally, a finally block executes cleanup code whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Memory management is important in Python because it ensures efficient use of system memory.It prevents memory leaks and keeps programs running smoothly.\n",
        "Automatic garbage collection frees unused memory to optimize performance.\n",
        "Good memory management improves reliability and scalability of applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "- try block contain the risky part of the code and except block actually handel the error if occured.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.  How does Python's garbage collection system work ?\n",
        "- Python’s garbage collection system automatically frees memory by removing objects that are no longer in use.\n",
        "It primarily uses reference counting, where each object keeps track of how many references point to it.\n",
        "When the reference count reaches zero, the memory is immediately deallocated.\n",
        "Additionally, Python uses a cyclic garbage collector to detect and clean up circular references that reference counting alone cannot resolve.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling ?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The else block in exception handling is used to run code only if no exception occurs in the try block.\n",
        "It helps separate normal execution from error-handling code.\n",
        "The else block improves readability and keeps logic clean.\n",
        "It executes right after the try block if everything runs successfully without errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The common logging levels in Python are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n",
        "DEBUG is used for detailed diagnostic information.\n",
        "INFO confirms that things are working as expected.\n",
        "WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL indicate increasing levels of seriousness for problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "- os.fork() directly creates a child process by duplicating the current process, and it works only on Unix-based systems like Linux and macOS. It provides low-level control but requires more manual handling of communication and synchronization.\n",
        "- the multiprocessing module is a high-level Python library that works on all major platforms including Windows, providing easy process creation and built-in support for communication through queues and pipes. It is safer, more portable, and simpler to use for parallel processing tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python ?\n",
        "- Closing a file in Python is important because it releases the system resources associated with the file.\n",
        "It ensures that all data is properly saved and written before the program ends.\n",
        "Not closing a file can lead to data corruption or loss.\n",
        "It also helps avoid memory leaks and improves program performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- file.read() reads the entire file content at once and returns it as a single string.\n",
        "\n",
        "- file.readline() reads only one line at a time from the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "- file.read() is useful when you need the complete file content, but it can use more memory for large files.\n",
        "\n",
        "- file.readline() is better for processing large files line by line without loading everything into memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for ?\n",
        "- The logging module in Python is used to record messages about the execution of a program.\n",
        "It helps developers track errors, warnings, and important events while the program runs.\n",
        "It allows logs to be saved to files or displayed on the console for debugging and monitoring.\n",
        "Using logging makes programs easier to diagnose, maintain, and analyze.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The os module in Python is used to interact with the operating system for file and directory operations.\n",
        "It allows tasks like creating, deleting, renaming, and navigating directories.\n",
        "You can also check file existence, permissions, and paths.\n",
        "Overall, it helps manage files and folders at the system level easily.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.  What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python ?\n",
        "- Some challenges associated with memory management in Python include handling reference cycles, where objects reference each other and delay garbage collection.\n",
        "The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can limit true parallelism and affect performance with multithreading.\n",
        "Managing memory usage for large data structures can become difficult and may lead to high memory consumption.\n",
        "Unintentional memory leaks can occur if references are not released properly or external resources aren’t closed.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python ?\n",
        "- You can raise an exception manually in Python using the raise keyword.\n",
        "This is useful when you want to intentionally trigger an error based on a specific condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications ?\n",
        "- Multithreading is important in certain applications because it allows multiple tasks to run concurrently within the same program, improving performance and responsiveness.\n",
        "It is especially useful for I/O-bound operations like file handling, network requests, or user interface activities where tasks often wait for external resources.\n",
        "Multithreading helps utilize waiting time efficiently, keeping the application active instead of idle.\n",
        "It improves user experience, enables real-time processing, and makes programs run more smoothly without freezing."
